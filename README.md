# Reflection

<!-- This is my 6-week summer project during my sophomore year in high school. The goal of this project is to learn new technologies and try my hand at a real-world project.

The project started with the desire to present and sell some of my own products. I started with a rough sketch in Figma and developed it into a full-fledged project later.

I started using `HTML` and `CSS` to style the website, but as the project grew in size, I studied and implemented `Tailwind CSS` into the project. This was another major change to the project and significantly sped up the process of writing the website.

In this project, I started learning how to use `Github` seriously and implemented it for the first time. This allowed me to learn another new technology.

And in this project, I learned about registering and using a domain with `Cloudflare` for the first time. It was quite exciting to have my own website and use `Cloudflare Tunnel` to bring it to the internet. -->

This was a 6-week summer project I completed during my high school sophomore year. The goal of the project was to learn new technologies and create a real-world application.

The project began with the desire to showcase and sell some of my own products. I started with rough sketches in `Figma` and then developed them into a complete design.

Initially, I used `HTML` and `CSS` for web page styling and `Node.js` with the `Express.js` framework for the backend. As the project grew larger, I learned about and implemented `Tailwind CSS`, which significantly improved the speed of writing web pages.

This project was my first serious experience using `Github`, which led to further learning about technology.

I also learned about registering and using domains with `Cloudflare`. It was exciting to have my own website and use `Cloudflare Tunnel` to deploy it to the internet.
